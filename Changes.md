# Change history for significant pattern releases

v1.3 - July 2026

* Adopt clustergroup/ACM `variants/` folder layout (`global.vpNewFolderDir`):
  * `variants/hub/` — baseline hub + `values-resilient.yaml` (full ODF spoke)
  * `variants/partner/` — partner hub + partner `values-resilient.yaml` (no ODF)
    and chart deltas (`values-regional-dr.yaml`, `values-odf-dr.yaml`) that disable
    DRPC/VM workloads and MirrorPeer while keeping Submariner and CA trust
* Declare install-time variants in `pattern-metadata.yaml` (`hub` default, `partner`).
* Prefer `main.variant` in `values-global.yaml` (requires clustergroup chart >= 0.9.57).
* Partner: Submariner, OADP, OCP-V, and ODF Multicluster Orchestrator (Ramen) without
  ODF StorageSystem, MirrorPeer, or Ramen DR CRs. Select with `main.variant: partner`.
* Partner leaves a commented subscription hook for an alternate (non-ODF) Ramen productization.
* Requires `regionaldr-with-virt` chart >= 0.0.4 (`ramen.resourcesEnabled` / `edgeGitopsVms.enabled`).

v1.0 - November 2025

* Arrange to default baseDomain settings appropriately so that forking the pattern is not a hard requirement
* Initial release

v1.0 - February 2026

* The names ocp-primary and ocp-secondary were hardcoded in various places, which caused issues when trying
to install two copies of this pattern into the same DNS domain.
* Also parameterize the version of edge-gitops-vms chart in case it needs to get updated. It too was hardcoded.
* Update to ACM 2.14 in prep for OCP 4.20+ testing.

v1.0 - March 2026

* Updated workload deployment script to check both clusters for workload instead of just the primary, in case
a failover was in progress at the time.
* Update ACM to 2.15 and golang-external-secrets. Move to 0.2 golang-secrets chart to allow use of v1 API. This is
in prep to move to OCP 4.20 as the default.
* Change machine instance type for submariner to allow deployment on 4.20.
* rdr chart previously used hardcoded and undocumented Vault secrets. Exposed these as variables and referenced
previously documented AWS secret instead of creating a new one with the same material).
* When OCP 4.20+ support is ready, there will be a v1.1 branch to use it.
* Externalize all charts to prep for subsequent demo pattern.
* Pass values-egv-dr into edge-gitops-vms chart. It used to use a symlink when it was local.

v1.1 - April 2026

* Change submariner to use vxlan mode by default, for compatibility reasons
* Default to OCP 4.20+. The subscription for OADP requires "stable" channel not "stable-1.4".
* Numerous small changes to deal with race conditions and other potential issues
* Introduce "BYOC" (bring-your-own-cluster) as an option for cluster provisioning (thanks @darkdoc)

v1.2 - June 2026

* Move cluster CA management stuff to a new namespace (cluster-ca-mgt)
* Use productized OpenShift External Secrets operator
* Default to OCP 4.22
* Update to ACM chart v0.2.*
* Use versioned charts for opp-policy, regionaldr, and application data protection
